                <p>
                    Bizz buzz (also known as <strong>fizz buzz</strong>, or simply buzz) is a group word game frequently encountered as a drinking game. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "bizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word bizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become bizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is either eliminated or must pay a forfeit, such as taking a drink.
                </p>

                <p>For example, a typical round of bizz buzz would start as follows:</p>

                <code>
                    1, 2, Bizz, 4, Buzz, Bizz, 7, 8, Bizz, Buzz, 11, Bizz, 13, 14, Bizz Buzz, 16, 17, Bizz, 19, Buzz, Bizz, 22, 23, Bizz, Buzz, 26, Bizz, 28, 29, Bizz Buzz, 31, 32, Bizz, 34, Buzz, Bizz, ...
                </code>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <p>
                Write a program that prints out the pattern generated by playing a variation of the Fizz Buzz game where we'll count from 1 to 100 replacing any number divisible by four with <code>Fizz</code>, any number divisible by six with <code>Buzz</code>, any number divisible by <strong>either</strong> four <strong>or</strong> six with <code>Fizz Buzz</code>, and any number divisible by the product of <code>4 x 6</code> with <code>Fizz Buzz BOOM</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to use the  <code>console.log()</code> you'll need to have Firebug or your browser's developer console enabled.
