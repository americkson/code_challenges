## Fizz Buzz Code Challenge 


__From Wikipedia:__

> Bizz buzz (also known as __fizz buzz__, or simply buzz) is a group word game frequently encountered as a drinking game. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "bizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
>
> Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word bizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become bizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is either eliminated or must pay a forfeit, such as taking a drink.
